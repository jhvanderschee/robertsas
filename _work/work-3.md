For these Three Wise Men from the east of Amsterdam the assignment was to create a corporate identity that could function as an umbrella for all of their (9!) restaurants and bars. We used their initials (3WO) and drew stripes that enter the logo from the east.

We are the proud partners in print and social design. [**Check out**](/work/print/) the recent posters we've created for their establishments.
