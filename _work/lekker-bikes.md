LEKKER is an honest bike brand that was born right here in Amsterdam and raised in Australia. We work closely together in realizing amazing online advertising. For this brand we continuously target and re-target their audience on Facebook. We target Australia and the whole of Europe, including the UK. We manage to identify the perfect audience per type of bike through Facebook’s target system. We’ve been able to increase their conversion, as well as their potential customers and website visitors with product re-targeting on Facebook and Facebook ads. Over the last two years we have been growing together through intensified personal collaboration.
