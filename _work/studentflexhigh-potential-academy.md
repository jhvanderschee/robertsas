Studentflex asked us to help them structure and nurtrige their online and offline marketing and help them reach their target audience.  We designed a custom marketing bible for them and their employees/interns to fall back to.

With this marketing plan and our strong affinity with young students we are able to write and design Facebook ads and reach potentials on the go.

Together with our partner in filming Zepic we created two movies that project their honest story. They reached students and encouraged potential clients to partner-up with them. With the usage of Facebook’s video advertising, these movies were able to reach a far greater audience than any ad we’ve done before.
