We’ve created a minimalistic, responsive website for Pie Aerts, a remarkably creative adventurer who lets his beautiful pictures do the talking for him. We did integrate a few subtle icons that you usually find on a camera, just to add that little extra. However, we think it’s important to let images speak for themselves - even more so in this case.

## [**Visit Pie**](http://www.pieaerts.com/)

So enough with words: go and check out this amazing art!

## [Pie Aerts Shopify Webshop](https://shop.pieaerts.com/collections)

After the website was done, Pie decided to start selling his art so you can hang his beautiful pictures on your wall! So we've created a minimalistic Shopify store where Pie sells his artwork! Interested? Go check it out, you'll love it!
