In the last months of 2017 we’ve proudly rebranded this creative Amsterdam based law firm.  Our goal was to translate their creative approach together with their outspoken expertise in multiple jurisdictions. The briefing was to create a professional appearance with a creative touch. The new logo & website presents their creativity as for their professional approach to each of their law expertises.

The ampersand in the logo has a subtle touch of a tail of a fox. The website has multiple integrated items to show there infinite knowledge within law, but with a subtle creative touch. We’ve paid special attention to the personal pages of the different lawyers so that they could promote their own practises.
