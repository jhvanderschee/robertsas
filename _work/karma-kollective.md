Our friends of this experience agency, which we have worked with before, wanted to take their brand in a different direction and thus came to us with the challenging and beautiful task to rebrand their company. With long and intensive sessions we have created a brand name that tells their special story, a website that presents their story and a logo identity that captures it.
