SEO (short for Search Engine Optimization), is really, really important for your e-commerce store or site. In a nutshell, SEO is the process of improving a website or web shop’s visibility in search engines. Why is that important? Well, the higher you rank in search engines, the more traffic and potential customers get driven to your store.
